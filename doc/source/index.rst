Welcome to Bioinformatics Algorithms's documentation!
=====================================================

In this documentation you'll find the methods needed to solve the problems in the
MOOC `Bioinformatics Algorithms (Part I)`_ from Coursera. Also, as I think the theory behind
the course is as interesting as the algorithms, here you will find also a summary
of the course theory. 

Please note that this theory is just a summary of the content of the course, so
all the merits go, obviously, to the course instructors and creators.
