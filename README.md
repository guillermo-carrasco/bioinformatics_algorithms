## Bioinformatics Algorithms I
This course is the first in a two-part series covering some of the algorithms underlying bioinformatics. 
It will cover some of the algorithms underlying the following fundamental topics in bioinformatics: 
assembling genomes, comparing DNA and protein sequences, finding regulatory motifs, 
analyzing genome rearrangements, identifying proteins, and many other topics.
